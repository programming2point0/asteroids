# Asteroids
This isn't the classic *Asteroids* game, but a simple little shoot'em'up, where you control a spaceship and have to avoid, or destroy the oncoming asteroids.

The game itself isn't that important, the code is used as a demonstration for various programming concepts.
Each branch is a new version of the same game, with improvements in code structure, and sometimes with added features.

## 00-starter
The first branch is the original code - compact but quite unreadable.

## 01-abstraction
The next branch is the improvements achieved solely by abstracting some of the functionality into aptly named functions.
I explain and demonstrate the entire process, as well as the reasoning behind, in the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyx25adnN6A
